# Lesson 1: Review of Gauge Theory for Mathematicians

This chapter provides an introduction to gauge theory, a branch of differential geometry that has important applications in theoretical physics. We will cover the key concepts and structures in gauge theory, aiming to make the material accessible to pure mathematicians with a background in algebra but potentially less familiarity with differential geometry and physics.

## 1. Principal Bundles

### Historical Context and Motivation

The theory of principal bundles and connections arose from the need to generalize classical field theories to incorporate more complex geometric structures. Principal bundles provide an elegant framework for describing gauge fields in theoretical physics, where the gauge group encodes the symmetries of the physical system under consideration.

### Definition and Structure

A principal \( G \)-bundle \( \pi: P \to M \) consists of the following data:

1. A smooth manifold \( M \) called the **base space**. In physics, \( M \) typically represents spacetime.

2. A smooth manifold \( P \) called the **total space**.

3. A Lie group \( G \) called the **structure group** or **gauge group**.

4. A smooth surjective map \( \pi: P \to M \) called the **projection**. The preimage \( \pi^{-1}(x) \) of each point \( x \in M \) is called the **fiber** over \( x \). The fibers are diffeomorphic to \( G \).

5. A smooth right action of \( G \) on \( P \) that preserves the fibers and is free and transitive on each fiber.

6. **Local triviality:** For each \( x \in M \), there exists an open neighborhood \( U \subseteq M \) containing \( x \) and a diffeomorphism \( \phi: \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times G \) such that \( \pi = \mathrm{pr}_1 \circ \phi \), where \( \mathrm{pr}_1 \) is the projection onto the first factor. The maps \( \phi \) are called **local trivializations**.

In essence, a principal bundle is a fiber bundle where the fibers are copies of the structure group \( G \), and the right action of \( G \) on \( P \) encodes the symmetries of the system.

### Examples

1. The **circle bundle**: Let \( M = S^1 \) (the circle) and \( G = \mathbb{R} \). The total space is \( P = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\} \), and the projection \( \pi: P \to M \) is given by \( \pi(x,y) = (x,y)/\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \). The fibers are copies of \( \mathbb{R} \), and the right action of \( \mathbb{R} \) on \( P \) is given by $(x,y) \cdot t = (e^{-t}x, e^{-t}y)$.

2. The **Hopf bundle**: Let \( M = S^2 \) (the 2-sphere), \( G = U(1) \), and \( P = S^3 \). The projection \( \pi: S^3 \to S^2 \) is the Hopf map, and the right action of \( U(1) \) on \( S^3 \) is given by complex multiplication.

### The Structure Group and Physical Forces

In gauge theory, the structure group \( G \) reflects the symmetries and type of gauge field under consideration. Different choices of \( G \) correspond to different fundamental forces in physics:

1. **Electromagnetic force:** \( G = U(1) \), the unitary group of degree 1. Elements of \( U(1) \) are complex numbers of unit modulus, representing phase rotations.

2. **Weak nuclear force:** \( G = SU(2) \), the special unitary group of degree 2. Elements of \( SU(2) \) are \( 2 \times 2 \) unitary matrices with determinant 1.

3. **Strong nuclear force:** \( G = SU(3) \), the special unitary group of degree 3. Elements of \( SU(3) \) are \( 3 \times 3 \) unitary matrices with determinant 1, and this group underlies the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

4. **Electroweak interaction:** \( G = U(1) \times SU(2) \), the direct product of \( U(1) \) and \( SU(2) \). This gauge group unifies the electromagnetic and weak forces.

5. **Grand Unified Theories (GUTs):** Larger groups like \( SU(5) \) or \( SO(10) \) are used in attempts to unify all fundamental forces under a single gauge group.

## 2. Lie Groups and Lie Algebras

### Lie Groups

A **Lie group** \( G \) is a smooth manifold that is also a group, where the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are smooth maps. Lie groups are the natural objects to use as structure groups in principal bundles, as they encode continuous symmetries.

Examples of common Lie groups in physics include:

1. The general linear group \(GL(n, \mathbb{R})\) of invertible \(n \times n\) real matrices.
2. The special linear group \(SL(n, \mathbb{R})\) of \(n \times n\) real matrices with determinant 1.
3. The orthogonal group \(O(n)\) of \(n \times n\) orthogonal matrices.
4. The special orthogonal group \(SO(n)\) of \(n \times n\) orthogonal matrices with determinant 1.
5. The unitary group \(U(n)\) of \(n \times n\) unitary matrices.
6. The special unitary group \(SU(n)\) of \(n \times n\) unitary matrices with determinant 1.

### Lie Algebras

Associated to each Lie group \( G \) is its **Lie algebra** \( \mathfrak{g} \), which can be thought of as the tangent space to \( G \) at the identity element. The Lie algebra encodes the infinitesimal structure of the Lie group.

More precisely, the Lie algebra \( \mathfrak{g} \) of a Lie group \( G \) is a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \) (or \( \mathbb{C} \)) equipped with a bilinear operation \( [\cdot,\cdot]: \mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g} \) called the **Lie bracket**, satisfying the following properties:

1. Antisymmetry: \( [X,Y] = -[Y,X] \) for all \( X,Y \in \mathfrak{g} \).
2. Jacobi identity: \( [X,[Y,Z]] + [Y,[Z,X]] + [Z,[X,Y]] = 0 \) for all \( X,Y,Z \in \mathfrak{g} \).

Examples of Lie algebras include:

1. The Lie algebra \( \mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{R}) \) of the general linear group, consisting of all \( n \times n \) real matrices.
2. The Lie algebra \( \mathfrak{sl}(n, \mathbb{R}) \) of the special linear group, consisting of all \( n \times n \) real matrices with trace 0.
3. The Lie algebra \( \mathfrak{so}(n) \) of the special orthogonal group, consisting of all \( n \times n \) skew-symmetric real matrices.
4. The Lie algebra \( \mathfrak{u}(n) \) of the unitary group, consisting of all \( n \times n \) skew-Hermitian matrices.
5. The Lie algebra \( \mathfrak{su}(n) \) of the special unitary group, consisting of all \( n \times n \) traceless skew-Hermitian matrices.

### Example: The Lie Algebra \( \mathfrak{su}(2) \)

The Lie algebra \( \mathfrak{su}(2) \) consists of \( 2 \times 2 \) traceless skew-Hermitian matrices. A basis for \( \mathfrak{su}(2) \) is given by the Pauli matrices:
\[ \sigma_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}. \]
The Lie bracket on \( \mathfrak{su}(2) \) is given by
\[ [\sigma_i, \sigma_j] = 2i \epsilon_{ijk} \sigma_k, \]
where \( \epsilon_{ijk} \) is the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita symbol.

## 3. Connections and Curvature

### Connection 1-Forms

A **connection** on a principal bundle \( \pi: P \to M \) is a way of specifying how to "connect" nearby fibers, allowing for the notion of parallel transport. Connections are described using differential forms on the total space \( P \).

A **connection 1-form** is a \( \mathfrak{g} \)-valued 1-form \( A \in \Omega^1(P, \mathfrak{g}) \) satisfying certain properties:

1. \( A \) is equivariant with respect to the right action of \( G \) on \( P \): \( R_g^* A = \mathrm{Ad}_{g^{-1}} A \) for all \( g \in G \), where \( R_g \) is the right action of \( g \) on \( P \) and \( \mathrm{Ad} \) is the adjoint representation of \( G \) on \( \mathfrak{g} \).

2. For each \( p \in P \), the restriction \( A_p: T_pP \to \mathfrak{g} \) of \( A \) to the tangent space \( T_pP \) is a linear isomorphism when restricted to the vertical subspace \( V_pP = \ker(d\pi_p) \).

The connection 1-form allows us to define **parallel transport** along curves in the base space \( M \). Given a curve \( \gamma: [0,1] \to M \) and a point \( p \in \pi^{-1}(\gamma(0)) \), the horizontal lift \( \tilde{\gamma}: [0,1] \to P \) of \( \gamma \) starting at \( p \) is the unique curve in \( P \) satisfying:

1. \( \pi \circ \tilde{\gamma} = \gamma \)
2. \( \tilde{\gamma}(0) = p \)
3. \( \tilde{\gamma}'(t) \in \ker(A_{\tilde{\gamma}(t)}) \) for all \( t \in [0,1] \).

Intuitively, the horizontal lift "parallely transports" the point \( p \) along the curve \( \gamma \), yielding a notion of parallel sections of the bundle.

### Curvature 2-Forms

The **curvature** of a connection \( A \) is a \( \mathfrak{g} \)-valued 2-form \( F_A \in \Omega^2(P, \mathfrak{g}) \) defined by
\[ F_A = dA + \frac{1}{2}[A,A], \]
where \( d \) is the exterior derivative and \( [\cdot,\cdot] \) is the Lie bracket on \( \mathfrak{g} \) extended to \( \mathfrak{g} \)-valued forms.

The curvature measures the failure of parallel transport along infinitesimal loops to return to the starting point. In physics, the curvature is interpreted as the field strength of the gauge field.

Under a change of connection \( A \mapsto A + \alpha \), where \( \alpha \in \Omega^1(P, \mathfrak{g}) \) is a tensorial 1-form (i.e., it vanishes on vertical vectors and is equivariant), the curvature transforms as
\[ F_{A+\alpha} = F_A + d\alpha + [A,\alpha] + \frac{1}{2}[\alpha,\alpha]. \]

### Gauge Transformations

A **gauge transformation** is a principal bundle automorphism \( \phi: P \to P \) that is equivariant with respect to the right action of \( G \) and covers the identity map on the base space \( M \). Gauge transformations form a group under composition, called the **gauge group** of the principal bundle.

Given a local section \( s: U \to P \) of the bundle over an open set \( U \subseteq M \), a gauge transformation can be described by a smooth map \( g: U \to G \), acting on the section as
\[ s(x) \mapsto s(x) \cdot g(x) \]
for all \( x \in U \).

Under a gauge transformation \( g: U \to G \), the connection 1-form \( A \) and curvature 2-form \( F_A \) transform as
\[ A \mapsto g^{-1}Ag + g^{-1}dg, \quad F_A \mapsto g^{-1}F_Ag. \]

## 4. Yang-Mills Theory

### The Yang-Mills Action

The **Yang-Mills action** is a functional on the space of connections on a principal bundle that generalizes the action of electromagnetism. For a principal bundle \( \pi: P \to M \) with structure group \( G \) and a connection \( A \), the Yang-Mills action is defined as
\[ S_{\text{YM}}(A) = -\frac{1}{2} \int_M \mathrm{tr}(F_A \wedge *F_A), \]
where \( F_A \) is the curvature of \( A \), \( * \) is the Hodge star operator defined by the metric on \( M \), and \( \mathrm{tr} \) is an invariant bilinear form on \( \mathfrak{g} \) (usually the Killing form).

The Yang-Mills action is invariant under gauge transformations, reflecting the gauge symmetry of the theory.

### The Yang-Mills Equations

The **Yang-Mills equations** are the Euler-Lagrange equations obtained by varying the Yang-Mills action with respect to the connection \( A \). They read
\[ D_A * F_A = 0, \]
where \( D_A \) is the covariant exterior derivative associated with the connection \( A \).

Solutions to the Yang-Mills equations are called **Yang-Mills connections** and describe the dynamics of the gauge field. The Yang-Mills equations generalize Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism to non-Abelian gauge theories.

In physics, the Yang-Mills equations describe the behavior of the fundamental forces associated with the gauge group \( G \). For example:

1. For \( G = U(1) \), the Yang-Mills equations reduce to Maxwell's equations, describing electromagnetism.
2. For \( G = SU(2) \), the Yang-Mills equations describe the weak nuclear force.
3. For \( G = SU(3) \), the Yang-Mills equations describe the strong nuclear force (quantum chromodynamics).

## Exercises

1. **Principal Bundle Construction:**
   Construct a principal \( U(1) \)-bundle over the 2-sphere \( S^2 \) using the Hopf fibration. Describe the local trivializations and transition functions.

   **Solution:**
   The Hopf fibration is a principal \( U(1) \)-bundle \( \pi: S^3 \to S^2 \), where the total space is the 3-sphere \( S^3 \), the base space is the 2-sphere \( S^2 \), and the structure group is \( U(1) \).

   To construct local trivializations, consider the stereographic projections from the north and south poles of \( S^2 \). These projections define two open sets \( U_N \) and \( U_S \) covering \( S^2 \), with \( U_N \cap U_S \cong S^1 \).

   Over each open set \( U_i \) (\( i = N, S \)), define a local trivialization \( \phi_i: \pi^{-1}(U_i) \to U_i \times U(1) \) by
   \[ \phi_i(z_1, z_2) = (\pi(z_1, z_2), z_1/|z_1|) \text{ for } (z_1, z_2) \in \pi^{-1}(U_N), \]
   \[ \phi_i(z_1, z_2) = (\pi(z_1, z_2), z_2/|z_2|) \text{ for } (z_1, z_2) \in \pi^{-1}(U_S). \]

   The transition function \( g_{NS}: U_N \cap U_S \to U(1) \) is given by
   \[ g_{NS}(z_1, z_2) = z_1/z_2 \text{ for } (z_1, z_2) \in U_N \cap U_S \subset S^2. \]

2. **Connection and Curvature:**
   Let \( \pi: P \to M \) be a principal \( G \)-bundle, and let \( A \) be a connection 1-form on \( P \). Show that the curvature 2-form \( F_A \) satisfies the Bianchi identity:
   \[ DF_A = dF_A + [A,F_A] = 0, \]
   where \( D \) is the covariant exterior derivative.

   **Solution:**
   By the definition of the curvature 2-form,
   \[ F_A = dA + \frac{1}{2}[A,A]. \]
   Applying the covariant exterior derivative \( D \), we get

   $$
   \begin{align*}
   DF_A &= d(dA + \frac{1}{2}[A,A]) + [A, dA + \frac{1}{2}[A,A]] \\
        &= \frac{1}{2}d[A,A] + [A, dA] + \frac{1}{2}[A,[A,A]] \\
        &= \frac{1}{2}([dA,A] - [A,dA]) + [A, dA] + \frac{1}{2}[A,[A,A]] \\
        &= [dA,A] + \frac{1}{2}[A,[A,A]] \\
        &= [dA + \frac{1}{2}[A,A], A] \\
        &= [F_A, A] \\
        &= -[A, F_A].
   \end{align*}
   $$
   Therefore,
   \[ DF_A = dF_A + [A,F_A] = 0. \]

3. **Gauge Invariance of the Yang-Mills Action:**
   Show that the Yang-Mills action \( S_{\text{YM}}(A) \) is invariant under gauge transformations.

   **Solution:**
   Let \( g: P \to P \) be a gauge transformation. Under this transformation, the connection 1-form \( A \) and curvature 2-form \( F_A \) transform as
   \[ A \mapsto g^{-1}Ag + g^{-1}dg, \quad F_A \mapsto g^{-1}F_Ag. \]
   The Yang-Mills action transforms as

   $$
   \begin{align*}
   S_{\text{YM}}(g^{-1}Ag + g^{-1}dg) &= -\frac{1}{2} \int_M \mathrm{tr}((g^{-1}F_Ag) \wedge *(g^{-1}F_Ag)) \\
                                      &= -\frac{1}{2} \int_M \mathrm{tr}(g^{-1}F_A \wedge *F_Ag) \\
                                      &= -\frac{1}{2} \int_M \mathrm{tr}(F_A \wedge *F_A) \\
                                      &= S_{\text{YM}}(A),
   \end{align*}
   $$

   where we have used the invariance of the trace and the Hodge star operator under gauge transformations. Therefore, the Yang-Mills action is gauge-invariant.
